# HashiConf Digital 2020: Terraform on Azure Coding Challenge üöÄ

Our [Azure Heroes](https://aka.ms/azure.heroes?ocid=aid3015373_ThankYou_DevComm&eventId=HashiConfTerraformonAzure_JK1-K2-hoArJ) badger has a startup idea that is out of this world! For their interstellar delivery service, they need your help developing an app leveraging the best of Terraform, Azure, and Azure managed Kubernetes. Help them deploy their application, so they can concentrate on the quality of their galactic snacks.

*Are you ready to show off your Terraform and Azure skills to send our astronaut badger into space?*


## How does it work? üß∞

This week (June 22-26), while HashiConf Digital takes place, we're releasing a **daily #TerraformOnAzure coding challenge**. You have **24 hours** to submit the solution for a coding challenge, before we publish a possible solution in this repo.

Of course, you're free to continue to work longer on your coding challenge and still it! We want to learn from you as well! The goal is for everyone to learn and expore.

We will release the first coding challenge on **Monday, June 22, at 2PM CEST sharp** ‚åö, right after the [HashiConf keynote](https://hashiconf.com/digital-june/).

Join, participate in all challenges, and claim your exclusive space-themed gift üéÅ!
